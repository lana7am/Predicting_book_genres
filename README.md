# Predicting book genre

predicting book genre based on book summary


## Background

when working with a large amount of books reading every book and trying to figure out what genre it is can be a time consuming task thats why we need to find a way to automate the process of genre labeling. 

## Data

the dataset was obtained by webscraping "abjjed" using the beautifulsoup python package
